### Javascript API based developments for improving your Alfresco experience

Alfresco is a fantastic suite for collaboration. Nevertheless, final and business users require frequently several modifications of the Alfresco interface and functionality OOTB, to customize and, in best cases, to improve Alfresco. In the presentation, I will talk about a set of Alfresco addons, that came from different conversations with clients. They are simple customizations of Alfresco that may be also a a good starting point for developing in Alfresco with Javascript API. All the addons presented are open source licensed and published in github.

The list of presented addons is the following:

  - Edit online with Libreoffice --> https://github.com/zylklab/alfresco-share-online-edition-addon
  - Custom Search Dashlet --> https://github.com/zylklab/zk-dynamic-searches-dashlet
  - Basic document lifecycle status --> https://github.com/zylklab/zk-zpm-statusable
  - Public url documents with effectivity --> https://github.com/zylklab/zk-qshared-effectivity
  - Short URLs for Alfresco Share --> https://github.com/zylklab/zk-url-shortener

Beside of its functionality interest, the above developments provides simple examples of Alfresco extensions such as:
  - Content models in Alfresco with its corresponding forms config (Shortable or Statusable Aspect)
  - Content behaviours (Public URLs with expiration & Short URLs)
  - JS-based Actions (Edit online with Libreoffice)
  - JS-based quartz jobs (Public URLs with expiration)
  - Dashlets (Custom Search Dashlet)
  - Metadata templates and custom indicators (Basic document lifecycle status, Public URLs with expiration & Short URLs)
  - Smart templates (Public URLs & Basic document lifecycle status)

that may be used as training pills for Alfresco developers.

### Sinadura ECM: Protocol-based signatures for Alfresco

Sinadura 5 is a popular java desktop client for signing documents. One of the new features of the last version is the addition to the main installer of a new mini-client designed for the web. This mini client was developed for the replacement of the java applet technology, by a protocol-based signature registered in your operating system. In this talk, we show the integration and possibilities of Sinadura 5 with Alfresco Share, relating to its advanced signature properties, profiles and visible stamps.

The main project involves the installation of two AMPs, a war for sinadura services (sinaduraCloud.war) and a desktop client for digital signature:
